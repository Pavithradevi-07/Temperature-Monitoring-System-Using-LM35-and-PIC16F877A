# Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-LM35-and-PIC16F877A
This project demonstrates a real-time temperature monitoring system using the LM35 temperature sensor interfaced with the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The analog temperature data from the sensor is read through the microcontroller's ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), processed, and displayed on a 16x2 LCD in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
